# Talktrans Project Overview

## Project Status
**This project has been migrated to Tuist** - it now uses Tuist for project generation and dependency management instead of traditional Xcode project files.

## Purpose
Talktrans (Talk-Translator) is an iOS application built with SwiftUI. The app appears to be a translation/communication app that integrates with KakaoTalk and includes features like speech recognition, contact access, and advertising (Google AdMob).

## Tech Stack
- **Language**: Swift 5.0
- **UI Framework**: SwiftUI
- **Project Management**: Tuist 4.104.5 (migrated project)
- **Tool Management**: mise (for managing Tuist version)
- **Testing Framework**: Swift Testing
- **Platform**: iOS 18.0+
- **Deployment Targets**: iPhone and iPad

## Tuist Project Structure
The project uses a modular workspace structure managed by Tuist. **Important**: The Xcode project files are generated by Tuist and should not be manually edited.

- **Workspace**: `sendadv` (defined in `Workspace.swift` at root)
- **Root Configuration**: 
  - `Workspace.swift` - Defines the workspace and included projects
  - `Tuist/Package.swift` - Tuist plugin dependencies
  - `mise.toml` - Tool version management
- **Projects** (each in `Projects/` directory):
  - `App`: Main application target with SwiftUI app
    - `Project.swift` - Project definition
    - `Tuist.swift` - Tuist configuration
    - `Sources/` - Application source code
    - `Resources/` - Assets and resources
    - `Tests/` - Unit tests
    - `Configs/` - Build configuration files (.xcconfig)
  - `ThirdParty`: Static framework containing third-party dependencies
    - `Project.swift` - Defines static framework with dependencies
  - `DynamicThirdParty`: Dynamic framework containing Firebase and SDWebImage
    - `Project.swift` - Defines dynamic framework with Firebase dependencies

## Key Dependencies
Managed via Swift Package Manager through Tuist:
- **Kakao SDK**: For KakaoTalk integration
- **Firebase**: Analytics, Crashlytics, Messaging, RemoteConfig
- **GADManager**: Google AdMob manager
- **SDWebImage**: Image loading
- **MBProgressHUD**: Progress indicators
- **LSExtensions**: Utility extensions
- **Material**: UI components

## Important Notes for Tuist Migration
- **Never edit generated Xcode project files directly** - all changes must be made in `Project.swift` files
- Always run `tuist generate` after modifying project definitions
- The workspace file (`talktrans.xcworkspace`) is generated by Tuist
- Dependencies are defined in `Project.swift` files using Tuist's package syntax
